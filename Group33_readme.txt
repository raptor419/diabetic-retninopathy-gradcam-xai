Title: Explainable Deep Learning for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Fundus Photographs

This is a classification Task in Diabetic Retinopathy images. User needs to provide the image file path in the input and receives the prediction as well as 
the explainable image showing how the model has predicted. We have provided a py file for activation map inference.

Format:

python Group33_code.py <input file>

here <input file> is an argument where you have to put image source path. If in the same directory then only name would also be fine.


Providing the data and all the other resources is not logistically possible as it is more than 80GB. 
All training and testing files are Colab(ipynb) notebooks and provided, bigger models are also only available online.
So we are not putting this in our deliverable folders. We are replicating and providing our google working environment as follows.
